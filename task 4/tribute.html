          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an
           Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from
            2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
             physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a 
             scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and 
             Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation 
             (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
              and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as
               the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal 
                organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II 
                nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by 
                India in 1974.
